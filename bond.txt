Bond… James Bond. Shocking. Positively shocking. I think he got the point. A martini. Shaken, not stirred. Well, let me try and enlarge your vocabulary. Well, hardest substance found in nature, they cut glass, suggest marriages, I suppose it replaced the dog as the girl's best friend. That's about it. Take a giant step for mankind. Wait 'til you get to my teeth. What? No small-talk? No chit-chat? That's the trouble with the world these days. Nobody takes the time to do a real sinister interrogation. It's a lost art. Oh, I travel... a sort of licensed troubleshooter. Run along now dear, man talk. That gun, it looks more fitting for a woman. No, but I know a little about women. The wine is quite excellent. Although for such a grand meal I would have expected a claret. Mouton Rothschild is a claret. And I've smelled that aftershave on you before, and both times I've smelled a rat. I know the rules, and number one is 'no deals. Sheer magnetism, darling. Well, I'm afraid you've caught me with more than my hands up. But James, I need you! So does England! My dear girl, there are some things that just aren't done, such as drinking Dom Perignon '53 above the temperature of 38 degrees Fahrenheit. That's just as bad as listening to the Beatles without earmuffs! I must be dreaming. Now put your clothes back on, and I'll buy you an ice cream. You don't think I enjoyed what we did this evening, do you? What I did tonight was for Queen and country!
